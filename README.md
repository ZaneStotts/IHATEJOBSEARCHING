## Description

This website is a record of my fight to find a job over the course of two years.

It hurt me.

It humbled me.

It hardened me.

It changed me fundamentally as a human. It taught me many difficult lessons about life I would've never learned another way.

Anybody viewing this website is looking at more than a log of applications. Visitors are looking at how I spent hours spent every single day. Weekends of nothing but browsing online job boards. Months of effort poured into crafting resumes, filling out employment history on repeat, answering a million questionnaires about my race and disability status.

When I first began this journey, my original goal was to switch career paths to something technology related and ideally remote.

I was applying to beginner roles for call centers, customer service reprsentatives data entry, and similar product support stuff.

But once I started feeling more confident in my programming skills and gaining certifications, I shifted focus over to the web development field. Openings in user experience, web design, front end maintenance, some back end processing work as well. Basically anything involving typing code on a computer.

I sincerely believed I had a chance. I know for certain I was prepared for a majority of the positions applied for.

Admittedly, I was probably unqualified for some of those jobs. I figured there was nothing to lose. All the company could do was say no. And all of them did.

My current job at the time was genuinely so unpleasant, I wanted out as fast as possible. So the desperation to find new work was really soaking in. I started applying to local roles I didn't even want but thought would maybe provide me some sort of way to recover.

Eventually, it happened.

The cherished dream of becoming a web developer has been put on the side line for now, since the likelihood is incredibly small. It feels like I can't justify the amount of time and effort. But the quest still equipped me with useful skills and a new passion. So I guess I didn't walk away with nothing.

I knew I had to do something with all the documentation I made over the years. It needed to exist outside of my private files. It needed to be shown to others. It needed to be a public testament to the crashing labor market of America.

So here we are.

The website obviously isn't finished yet. It'll probably take me a while.
