## Description

This website is a record of my fight to find a job over the course of two years.

It hurt me.

It humbled me.

It hardened me.

It changed me fundamentally as a human. It taught me many difficult lessons about life I would've never learned another way.

Anybody viewing this website is looking at more than a log of applications. Visitors are looking at how I spent hours spent every single day. Weekends of nothing but browsing online job boards. Months of effort poured into crafting resumes, filling out employment history on repeat, answering a million questionnaires about my race and disability status.

When I first began this journey, my original goal was to switch career paths to something technology related.

I was applying to beginner roles for call centers, customer service reprsentatives data entry, and similar product support stuff.

But once I started feeling more confident in my programming skills, I shifted focus over to the web development field. Positions in user experience, web design, front end maintenance, some back end processing work as well. Basically anything involving code.

I will admit I was unqualified for some of those jobs. I figured I had nothing to lose. All the company could do was say no. And all of them did.
