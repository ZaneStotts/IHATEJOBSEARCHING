## Description

This website is a record of my fight to find a job over the course of two years.

It hurt me.

It humbled me.

It hardened me.

It changed me fundamentally as a human. It taught me many difficult lessons about life I would've never learned another way.

Anybody viewing this website is looking at more than a log of applications. Visitors are looking at how I spent hours spent every single day. Weekends of nothing but browsing online job boards. Months of effort poured into crafting resumes, filling out employment history on repeat, answering a million questionnaires about my race and disability status. It's a peculiar kind of pain.

When I first began this journey, my original goal was to switch career paths to something technology related and ideally remote.

I was applying to beginner roles for call centers, customer service reprsentatives data entry, and similar product support stuff.

But once I started feeling more confident in my programming skills and gaining certifications, I shifted focus over to the web development field. Openings in user experience, web design, front end maintenance, some back end processing work as well. Basically anything involving typing code on a computer.

I sincerely believed I had a chance. I know for certain I was prepared for a majority of the positions applied for.

Admittedly, I was probably unqualified for some of those jobs. I figured I might as well try. There was nothing to lose. All the company could do was say no. And all of them did.

My current job at the time was genuinely so unpleasant, I wanted out as fast as possible. So the desperation to find new work was really soaking in. I started applying to local roles I didn't even want but thought would maybe provide me some sort of way to recover.

Eventually, it happened.

The cherished dream of becoming a web developer has been put on the side line for now, since the likelihood is incredibly small. I can't justify the amount of time and effort. But the quest still equipped me with useful skills and a new passion. So I guess I didn't walk away with nothing.

I knew I had to do something with all the applications I documented over the years. They needed to exist outside of my private files. They needed to be shown to others. They needed to be a public testament to the crashing labor market of America.

And so iHateJobSearching was created.

This project also might serve as a means for me to finally process all the resentment and frustration built up inside me along the way.

So here we are.

It obviously isn't finished yet. It'll probably take me a while. Progress is slow. But I'm trying.

## Languages

This website is entirely front end. Largely HTML and less CSS than usual. Probably the most JavaScript I've ever written for one of my projects before. I like seeing my improvement with languages which are more behind the scenes.

## Design

This website was designed with mobile devices in mind, which is increasingly apparent if ever viewed on a screen wider than 600 pixels.

My intention was not to make anything particularly flashy or visually striking. I wanted to get straight to the point. Of course, that could change in the future if I ever feel like it.

I chose fonts which are guaranteed to render the same on all browsers. A minimal styling aesthetic. No excessively bright color schemes. I don't want visitors to ever be confused or question what is happening on the screen.

## Reflections

This website has pushed me to try a lot new things with JavaScript so far, such as the counting animation when it first loads and the "see more" button function for the application list.

Writing comments is another habit I'm trying to instill in myself so I can better comprehend what each line means and the logic behind it. I've always felt like I should be able to display and explain my reasoning behind each code choice. It also helps me make sense of what each element represents when I review things again.

I still have more plans for visualizing data and adding sorting features. I want to make things more interactive for users.

Honestly, most of my reflections for this project have little to do with web development and more to do with the story it personifies—my story. Anybody who has endured the grueling modern day job search process already understands.
